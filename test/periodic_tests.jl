    # Having support for infinite tspans is one of the main reasons for implementing PeriodicCallback
    # using add_tstop!, instead of just passing in a linspace as the tstops solve argument.
    # (the other being that the length of the internal tstops collection would otherwise become
    # linear in the length of the integration time interval.
    #
    # Testing a finite tspan is necessary because a naive implementation could add tstops after
    # tmax and thus integrate for too long (or even indefinitely).
