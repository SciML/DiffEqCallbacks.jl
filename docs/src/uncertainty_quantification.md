# Uncertainty Quantification

The following callbacks are designed to help enable uncertainty quantification of the
differential equation solutions.

ProbIntsUncertainty
AdaptiveProbIntsUncertainty
```

## Example 1: FitzHugh-Nagumo

In this example we will determine our uncertainty when solving the FitzHugh-Nagumo
model with the `Euler()` method. We define the FitzHugh-Nagumo model:

```@example probnum
using DiffEqCallbacks, OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots
gr(fmt = :png)

function fitz(du, u, p, t)
    V, R = u
    a, b, c = p
    du[1] = c * (V - V^3 / 3 + R)
    du[2] = -(1 / c) * (V - a - b * R)
end
u0 = [-1.0; 1.0]
tspan = (0.0, 20.0)
p = (0.2, 0.2, 3.0)
prob = ODEProblem(fitz, u0, tspan, p)
```

Now we define the `ProbInts` callback. In this case, our method is the `Euler`
method and thus it is order 1. For the noise scaling, we will try a few different
values and see how it changes. For `σ=0.2`, we define the callback as:

```@example probnum
cb = ProbIntsUncertainty(0.2, 1)
```

This is akin to having an error of approximately 0.2 at each step. We now build
and solve a [EnsembleProblem](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/features/ensemble/) for 20 trajectories (reduced from 100 to keep documentation size manageable):

```@example probnum
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Euler(), trajectories = 20, callback = cb, dt = 1 / 10)
```

Now we can plot the resulting Monte Carlo solution:

```@example probnum
plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.8)
```

If we increase the amount of error, we see that some parts of the
equation have less uncertainty than others. For example, at `σ=0.5`:

```@example probnum
cb = ProbIntsUncertainty(0.5, 1)
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Euler(), trajectories = 20, callback = cb, dt = 1 / 10)
plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.8)
```

But at this amount of noise, we can see how we contract to the true solution by
decreasing `dt`:

```@example probnum
cb = ProbIntsUncertainty(0.5, 1)
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Euler(), trajectories = 20, callback = cb, dt = 1 / 100)
plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.8)
```

## Example 2: Adaptive ProbInts on FitzHugh-Nagumo

While the first example is academic and shows how the ProbInts method
scales, the fact that one should have some idea of the error in order
to calibrate `σ` can lead to complications. Thus the more useful method
in many cases, is the `AdaptiveProbIntsUncertainty` version. In this
version, no `σ` is required since this is calculated using an internal
error estimate. Thus this gives an accurate representation of the
possible error without user input.

Let's try this with the order 5 `Tsit5()` method on the same problem as before:

```@example probnum
cb = AdaptiveProbIntsUncertainty(5)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), trajectories = 20, callback = cb)
plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.8)
```

In this case, we see that the default tolerances give us a very good solution. However, if we increase the tolerance a lot:

```@example probnum
cb = AdaptiveProbIntsUncertainty(5)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), trajectories = 20, callback = cb, abstol = 1e-3,
    reltol = 1e-1)
plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.8)
```

we can see that the moments just after the rise can be uncertain.

## Example 3: Adaptive ProbInts on the Lorenz Attractor

One very good use of uncertainty quantification is on chaotic models. Chaotic
equations diverge from the true solution according to the error exponentially.
This means that as time goes on, you get further and further from the solution.
The `ProbInts` method can help diagnose how much of the timeseries is reliable.

As in the previous example, we first define the model:

```@example probnum
function g(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = p[1] * (u[2] - u[1])
    du[2] = u[1] * (p[2] - u[3]) - u[2]
    du[3] = u[1] * u[2] - p[3] * u[3]
end
u0 = [1.0; 0.0; 0.0]
tspan = (0.0, 30.0)
p = [10.0, 28.0, 8 / 3]
prob = ODEProblem(g, u0, tspan, p)
```

and then we build the `ProbInts` type. Let's use the order 5 `Tsit5` again.

```@example probnum
cb = AdaptiveProbIntsUncertainty(5)
```

Then we solve the `MonteCarloProblem`

```@example probnum
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), trajectories = 100, callback = cb)
# Note: Plot generation disabled to reduce documentation size
# The plot would show trajectories diverging around t=22
# plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.4)
```

![Lorenz Attractor with Uncertainty Quantification](assets/lorenz_uq_tsit5.png)

Here we see that by `t` about 22 we start to receive strong deviations from the "true" solution.
We can increase
the amount of time before error explosion by using a higher order method
with stricter tolerances:

```@example probnum
tspan = (0.0, 40.0)
prob = ODEProblem(g, u0, tspan, p)
cb = AdaptiveProbIntsUncertainty(7)
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Vern7(), trajectories = 100, callback = cb, reltol = 1e-6)
# Note: Plot generation disabled to reduce documentation size
# The plot would show extended trajectories before divergence
# plot(sim, idxs = (0, 1), linealpha = 0.4)
```

![Extended Lorenz Attractor with Higher Order Method](assets/lorenz_uq_vern7.png)

we see that we can extend the amount of time until we deviate strongly from the "true" solution.
Of course, for a chaotic system like the Lorenz one presented here, it is impossible to follow the true solution
for long times, due to the fact that the system is chaotic and unavoidable deviations due to the numerical precision of a computer get amplified exponentially.

However, not all hope is lost. The [shadowing theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ShadowingTheorem.html) is a strong statement for having confidence in numerical evolution of chaotic systems:

> Although a numerically computed chaotic trajectory diverges exponentially from the true trajectory with the same initial coordinates, there exists an errorless trajectory with a slightly different initial condition that stays near ("shadows") the numerically computed one.

For more info on the shadowing theorem, please see the book *Chaos in Dynamical Systems* by E. Ott.
