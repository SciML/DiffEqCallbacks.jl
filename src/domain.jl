A `GeneralDomain` callback in DiffEqCallbacks.jl generalizes the concept of
a `PositiveDomain` callback to arbitrary domains. Domains are specified by
in-place functions `g(resid, u, p)` or `g(resid, u, p, t)` that calculate residuals of a
state vector `u` at time `t` relative to that domain, with `p` the parameters of the
corresponding integrator. As for `PositiveDomain`, steps are accepted if residuals
of the extrapolated values at the next time step are below
a certain tolerance. Moreover, this callback is automatically coupled with a
`ManifoldProjection` that keeps all calculated state vectors close to the desired
domain, but in contrast to a `PositiveDomain` callback the nonlinear solver in a
`ManifoldProjection` cannot guarantee that all state vectors of the solution are
actually inside the domain. Thus, a `PositiveDomain` callback should generally be
preferred.

## Arguments

  - `g`: the implicit definition of the domain as a function `g(resid, u, p)` or
    `g(resid, u, p, t)` which is zero when the value is in the domain.
  - `u`: A prototype of the state vector of the integrator. A copy of it is saved and
    extrapolated values are written to it. If it is not specified,
    every application of the callback allocates a new copy of the state vector.

## Keyword Arguments

  - `save`: Whether to do the standard saving (applied after the callback).
  - `abstol`: Tolerance up to, which residuals are accepted. Element-wise tolerances
    are allowed. If it is not specified, every application of the callback uses the
    current absolute tolerances of the integrator.
  - `scalefactor`: Factor by which an unaccepted time step is reduced. If it is not
    specified, time steps are halved.
  - `autonomous`: Whether `g` is an autonomous function of the form `g(resid, u, p)`.
    If it is not specified, it is determined automatically.
  - `kwargs`: All other keyword arguments are passed to `ManifoldProjection`.
  - `nlsolve_kwargs`: All keyword arguments are passed to the nonlinear solver in
    `ManifoldProjection`. The default is `(; abstol = 10 * eps())`.

```julia
PositiveDomain(u = nothing; save = true, abstol = nothing, scalefactor = nothing)
```

Especially in biology and other natural sciences, a desired property of
dynamical systems is the positive invariance of the positive cone, i.e.
non-negativity of variables at time ``t_0`` ensures their non-negativity at times
``t \geq t_0`` for which the solution is defined. However, even if a system
satisfies this property mathematically it can be difficult for ODE solvers to
ensure it numerically, as these [MATLAB examples](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/nonnegative-ode-solution.html)
show.

To deal with this problem, one can specify `isoutofdomain=(u,p,t) -> any(x
-> x < 0, u)` as additional [solver option](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/common_solver_opts/),
which will reject any step that leads to non-negative values and reduce the next
time step. However, since this approach only rejects steps and hence
calculations might be repeated multiple times until a step is accepted, it can
be computationally expensive.

Another approach is taken by a `PositiveDomain` callback in
DiffEqCallbacks.jl, which is inspired by
[Shampine's et al. paper about non-negative ODE solutions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300304009683).
It reduces the next step by a certain scale factor until the extrapolated value
at the next time point is non-negative with a certain tolerance. Extrapolations
are cheap to compute but might be inaccurate, so if a time step is changed it
is additionally reduced by a safety factor of 0.9. Since extrapolated values are
only non-negative up to a certain tolerance and in addition actual calculations
might lead to negative values, also any negative values at the current time point
are set to 0. Hence, by this callback non-negative values at any time point are
ensured in a computationally cheap way, but the quality of the solution
depends on how accurately extrapolations approximate next time steps.

Please note, that the system should be defined also outside the positive domain,
since even with these approaches, negative variables might occur during the
calculations. Moreover, one should follow Shampine's et al. advice and set the
derivative ``x'_i`` of a negative component ``x_i`` to ``\max \{0, f_i(x, t)\}``,
where ``t`` denotes the current time point with state vector ``x`` and ``f_i``
is the ``i``-th component of function ``f`` in an ODE system ``x' = f(x, t)``.

## Arguments

- `u`: A prototype of the state vector of the integrator. A copy of it is saved and
  extrapolated values are written to it. If it is not specified,
  every application of the callback allocates a new copy of the state vector.

## Keyword Arguments

- `save`: Whether to do the standard saving (applied after the callback).
- `abstol`: Tolerance up to, which negative extrapolated values are accepted.
  Element-wise tolerances are allowed. If it is not specified, every application
  of the callback uses the current absolute tolerances of the integrator.
- `scalefactor`: Factor by which an unaccepted time step is reduced. If it is not
  specified, time steps are halved.
